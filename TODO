TODO
====

  - figure out how to get rid of the wrapper script or
    add one to the distribution
  - pretty up the rendering/scrolling code
  - add directory support
  - add WINCH support (idk if it even transfers over telnet)
  - maybe add file caching
  - maybe add inotify support for live directory indexing
  - add a way to do animations (either via frames or executable load)
